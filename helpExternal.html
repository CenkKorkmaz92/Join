                    <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="join">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
                        project management tool.
                        Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="join">Join</span> is, how it can benefit
                        you, and how to use it.</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-headline">What is Join?</h2>
                    <p><span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                        group of dedicated
                        students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
                    <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit work-in-progress,
                        and maximize efficiency. <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to
                        help users manage their
                        tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                        exercise and is not intended
                        for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we
                        cannot guarantee consistent
                        availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span
                            class="join">Join</span>.</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-headline">How to use it</h2>
                    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join">Join</span>:</p>

                                <p>When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                                    board represents your
                                    project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback",
                                    and "Done".</p>

                                <p>In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                                    projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                    section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
                                    these contacts can be
                                    assigned tasks and interact with tasks on the board.</p>

                                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                    individual tasks. Click the "+"
                                    button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                                    like task name, description,
                                    due date, and assignees.</p>

                                <h3 class="sub-sub-headline">Moving Cards</h3>
                                <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                    dragging and dropping the card
                                    from one list to another.</p>

                                <h3 class="sub-sub-headline">Deleting Cards</h3>
                                <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently
                                    remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                                    action is irreversible.</p>
                                <p>Remember that using <span class="join">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
                                    updates from you and your team
                                    to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.</p>
